"""
We're provided a positive integer num. Can you write a method to repeatedly add all of its digits until the result has only one digit?

Here's an example: if the input was 49, we'd go through the following steps:

SNIPPET
1
// start with 49
2
4 + 9 = 13
3
â€‹
4
// move onto 13
5
1 + 3 = 4
We would then return 4.
