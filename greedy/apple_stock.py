Writing programming interview questions hasn’t made me rich yet … so I might give up and start trading Apple stocks all day instead.

First, I wanna know how much money I could have made yesterday if I’d been trading Apple stocks all day.

So I grabbed Apple’s stock prices from yesterday and put them in a list called stock_prices, where:

The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stock_prices[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices and returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

stock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get_max_profit(stock_prices)
# Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
No “shorting”—you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can’t buy and sell in the same time step—at least 1 minute has to pass.

"""

def get_max_profit(stock_prices):
    if  len(stock_prices) < 2:
        raise ValueError('At least 2 prices are required to get a profit')
    min_price = stock_prices[0]
    max_profit = stock_prices[1] - stock_prices[0]
    for time in range(1, len(stock_prices)):
        current_price = stock_prices[time]
        temp_profit = current_price - min_price
        if temp_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = temp_profit
    return max_profit
